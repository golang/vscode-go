## v0.48.0

Date: 2025-06-30

### Changes

* Introduced quick pick separator in command `Go: Choose Go Environment` showing
diff between options locally discovered and options available for download.
* Added support for golangci-lint v2 ([Issue 3732](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3732))
  * Added a new lint tool, `golangci-lint-v2`. It's added as an installable tool, so you can install it via the `Go: Install/Update Tools` command.
  * You can switch v1 and v2 per workspace by using `golangci-lint` and `golangci-lint-v2` option. You must keep the `golangci-lint` executable version on your machine to v1 for that.
  * You can also use `golangci-lint` executable updated to v2. Just keep using the `golangci-lint` option for that.
  * The `path-mode` flag set by vscode-go can be overridden by the`go.lintFlags` option.
  * Looking for a way to format your code with golangci-lint v2 on VS Code? Check the [golangci-lint documentation](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/integrations/#visual-studio-code).

### Fixes

* Addressed an issue that caused a `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'Token')`
error during command execution when the command result did not include a token.
([Issue 3698](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3698))
* Addressed an issue that broke the `Debug Subtest At Cursor` command. ([Issue 3718](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3718))

**Milestone**: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues?q=milestone%3Av0.46.0

## v0.44.0

Date: 2024-12-16

### Changes

* Gopls v0.17: The latest gopls version as of this release is [gopls v0.17](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.17.0). The extension settings documentation has been updated to align with the latest gopls settings.
* Increased the [Go telemetry](https://go.dev/doc/telemetry) prompt rate to 100%.
* Debugging: will not open Debug Console when `debug.internalConsoleOption` is `neverOpen`. ([CL 627675](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/627675))

#### Tools installation

* The extension requires go1.21 or newer when it installs required tools. If your project must use go1.20 or older,
please manually install [compatible versions of required tools](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/compatibility),
or configure the [`"go.toolsManagement.go"` setting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings#gotoolsmanagementgo)
to use the go1.21 or newer when installing tools. ([Issue 3411](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3411))

### Code Health

* Extension build target is set to `es2022`. ([Issue 3540](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3540))
* The extension release workflow is migrated to the Go project's [Relui](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/build/cmd/relui#section-readme). ([Issue 3500](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3500))

### Testing

A new extension, [Go Companion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ethan-reesor.exp-vscode-go), has been released with experimental support for gopls-based test discovery. If Go Companion is installed, pre-release versions of this extension will automatically disable its test explorer in favor of Go Companion's implementation. See [experiments](./docs/experiments.md#test-explorer) for details on Go Companion's features and for disabling the automatic switchover.

## v0.43.4 (prerelease)

Date: 2024-12-05

This is the [pre-release version](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions) of v0.44.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.42.0-rc.1...v0.43.4
**Milestone**: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues?q=milestone%3Av0.44.0

## v0.43.3 (prerelease)

Date: 2024-11-18

This is the [pre-release version](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions) of v0.44.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.42.0-rc.1...v0.43.3
**Milestone**: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues?q=milestone%3Av0.44.0

## v0.42.1

Date: 9 Sep, 2024

A comprehensive list of changes can be found in the complete [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.42.0..v0.42.1).

### Changes

* Prompt users for the [2024 Go Developer survey](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ei0CDV2K9qQIsp8?s=p). ([Issue 3517](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3517))
* Updated the default versions of `gomodifytags`, `impl`, `gofumpt`, and `revive`. ([CL 607757](https://go.dev/cl/607757)).
* Increased the Go telemetry prompt rate to 25%. The new Go blog post ["Telemetry in Go 1.23 and beyond"](https://go.dev/blog/gotelemetry) discusses how Go telemetry helps improving the reliability and the performance of go toolchain programs.

## v0.43.0 (pre-release)

Date: 22 Aug, 2024

This is the [pre-release version](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions) of v0.44. The nightly (golang.go-nightly) extension will be deprecated in favor of the pre-release version.

## v0.42.0

Date: 17 Jul, 2024

A comprehensive list of changes can be found in the complete [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.4..v0.42.0).

### Updates in `gopls`

* Gopls v0.16: The latest gopls version as of this release is [gopls v0.16](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.16.0). The extension settings documentation has been updated to align with the latest gopls settings.
* The gopls project provides an index of [all supported features](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls/doc/features). We are working on making this documentation more accessible from the extension. Please stay tuned for updates.

### Updates in telemetry

This extension continues to use [Go toolchain telemetry](https://go.dev/doc/telemetry).
By default, telemetry data is kept only on the local computer, but you can opt in to share it with the Go team with one of the following ways:

- `go run golang.org/x/telemetry/cmd/gotelemetry@latest on` in the terminal, or
- `go telemetry on`, from go1.23, or
- Respond to the prompt when it appears.

Once uploading is enabled, the data will be sent to https://telemetry.go.dev approximately once a week.

### Changes

#### Tools installation

* For tools installation managed by the extension, this version requires go1.19 or newer version. The next minor release (v0.43.0+) will require go1.21 or newer to install tools. If your project requires go1.20 or older to build, you will need to manually install [compatible versions of tools](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/tools), or configure the [`"go.toolsManagement.go"` setting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings#gotoolsmanagementgo) to use go1.21+ when installing the tools.

* The extension installs its required tools using the `go install` command. Starting go1.21, the `go` command allows tool authors to specify the minimum Go version required to build their tools. If the required go toolchain version is not locally available, the `go` command needs to download it like other dependencies of the tool. To ensure this toolchain switch works correctly, the extension enforces `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` mode during tools installation. Note that this change does not affect how it builds and tests your own project.  For more information about Go's toolchain switch behavior, see the [official documentation](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain).

#### Debugging

* The default launch.json template for "Go: Launch Package" was updated to use `"${workspaceFolder}${1:}"` instead of `"${fileDirname}"` as the default `"program"` attribute value. If the package to debug is located in the subdirectory, adjust the configuration to point to the main package path. The [official VS Code Variables Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference) lists useful substitution rules you can use in adjusting your launch.json setting.

Thanks for your contributions, @yimiaoxiehou!


## v0.41.4

Date: 24 Apr, 2024

This point release addresses a regression issue (spurious display of the Go welcome page)  within cloud-based IDEs.

See the full
[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.3...v0.41.4)
for detailed changes.

## v0.41.3

Date: 22 Apr, 2024

This point release temporarily reverts the default remote debugging behavior to
use the legacy debug adapter due to existing feature gaps.
Once these gaps are addressed as outlined in
[Issue 3096](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3096),
we plan to switch the default back to use Delve DAP for remote deubgging.

If you want to continue using [Delve DAP for remote debugging](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging#connect-to-headless-delve-with-target-specified-at-server-start-up), use the following
settings in your `launch.json`.

```json
{
    "name": "Debug Remote",
    "type": "go",
    "request": "attach",
    "mode": "remote",
    "debugAdapter": "dlv-dap", // Use Delve DAP
    ...
}
```

See the full
[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.2...v0.41.3)
for detailed changes.

### Fixes
- Fixed to substitute variables used in `go.alternateTools` setting's
  `customFormatter` entry ([Issue 2582](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2582)).
- Corrected handling of `go.showWelcome` setting
  ([Issue 3319](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3319)).
- Addressed Go telemetry prompt issue in the latest Visual Studio Code
  ([Issue 3312](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3312)).

### Thanks

Thanks for your contributions, @uniquefine, @monitor1379, @suzmue, @hyangah!

## v0.41.2

Date: 14 Mar, 2024

This release is a point release to increase the prompt rate of Go telemetry
opt-in. Learn more at https://go.dev/doc/telemetry.
For a detailed list of changes, refer to the complete
[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.1...v0.41.2).

### Fixes
- Fixed [Issue 2414](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2414) that prevented
recognizing testify suites spanning multiple files. ([PR 3128](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/pull/3128))
- Fixed the "Open 'gopls' trace" submenu in "Go: Choose Go Environment" command. ([Issue 3236](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3236))

### Thanks

Thanks for your contributions! @Cr4zySheep, @nirhaas

## v0.41.1

Date: 22 Feb, 2024

This release is a point release to skip `vscgo` installation on Windows
([Issue 3182](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3182)).
For a detailed list of changes, refer to the complete
[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.0...v0.41.1).

## v0.41.0

Date: 14 Feb, 2024

This release introduces significant updates to the extension's UI.
We also want to share the news that the [gopls v0.15 release](https://go.dev/s/gopls-v0.15)
enhances the multi-module workspace experience and improves build tag handling.

For a detailed list of changes, refer to the complete [commit
history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.40.3...v0.41.0).

### Changes

#### Gopls v0.15.0 and Workspace Configuration
* The gopls v0.15 introduces a [significant change](https://go.dev/s/gopls-v0.15)
  in its internal workspace data model. Known as ["zero configuration"
  gopls](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57979), `gopls` can automatically
  determines workspace configurations such as Go module boundaries and necessary
  GOOS/GOARCH build tags for open Go files. This eliminates the need for users
  to align the VS Code workspace root folders with the Go module root folder.
* For more details and additional feature updates, refer to the [gopls v0.15.0
  release notes](https://go.dev/s/gopls-v0.15). The extension's
  settings have been updated to align with gopls v0.15.0 settings.

#### UI Updates
* A new [language status
  bar](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui#using-the-language-status-bar)
  is added, visible when working on Go-related files. The [Go status
  bar](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui#using-the-go-status-bar),
  which displays the selected Go version and the gopls status, is now located at
  the bottom right of the window and is visible only when Go files are open.
* The "Go" and "Go Debug" output channels are now primarily used for logging
  extension activities such as dependency tool installation, invocation, and
  debug logging. Use the `"Developer: Set Log Level..."` command to adjust the
  logging level. The `go.logging.level` setting is deprecated in favor of this
  new logging mechanism.
* The `"Go: Locate Configured Go Tools"` command now opens an untitled file and
  dumps the tools information there, instead of printing it in the "Go" output
  channel. This change allows users to inspect and edit the output easily before
  sharing it in their issue report.

#### Debugging
* [Remote
  debugging](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging#remote-debugging)
  now defaults to using delve DAP. The legacy debug adapter will be removed in
  the next release cycle.
* [Delve
  1.22.0](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1220-2023-12-29)
  introduces new options to [display 'pprof'
  labels](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/issues/3493) and [use concise symbol
  and stack presentation](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/issues/3516). Update
  delve to the latest version using the `"Go: Install/Update Tools"` command.

#### Tools
* For new users, the extension will automatically install important tools
  (`gopls` and an optionally selected extra lint tool such as `staticcheck` or
  `golangci-lint`) if they are missing, using `go install` commands. Any
  installation failures will be surfaced in the [language status
  bar](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui#using-the-go-status-bar) and
  the "Go" output channel.
* The extension does not require `dlv` installation until the debug feature is
  invoked.
* The extension now installs
  [`vscgo`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/vscode-go/vscgo), an
  optional tool used to [update the Go telemetry
  counters](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3121). This tool is
  installed in the extension's directory.

#### Telemetry
* The Go telemetry now measures activation latency. ([CL
  549244](https://go-review.git.corp.google.com/c/vscode-go/+/549244))

### Fixes
* The extension now recognizes idx as a Web IDE. ([CL
  559895](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/559895))
* The deprecated `web-request` has been replaced with `node-fetch@v2`. ([Issue
  2995](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2995))

### Development Process Updates
* The repository layout has been updated with the extension code moved to the
  `extension/` directory. See [Issue
  3122](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3122) for more details.
* The extension release workflow has been moved to Google Cloud Build.

## v0.40.3

Date: 22 Jan, 2024

This is a point release to update the upcoming developer survey information
([the commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.40.1...v0.40.3)).

## v0.40.1

Date: 21 Dec, 2023

This is a point release to fix minor bugs. A comprehensive list of bug fixes and
changes can be found in
[the milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/60) and
[the commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.40.0...v0.40.1).

### Changes

* We adjusted the extension activation behavior. The extension will not be
  activated until Go files are open or the extension's commands are invoked.
  ([Issue 3038](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3038), and
  [2164](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2164)).
* The [`GOTOOLCHAIN`](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain) environment variable is
  shown from the [Go explorer
  view](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui#go-explorer-view).

### Fixes

* [Pprof result viewer](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/features#profiling)
  now works with the [remote development setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview).
  ([Issue 3090](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3090)).
* Subtests that include regexp metacharacters in their names are now properly
  handled. ([Issue 2624](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2624),
  [3070](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3070))
* When the extension detects `go` installed by snap, it will use
  `/snap/go/current/bin/go` as the go command path to work around a bug in
  snapd. ([Issue 166](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/166)).
* We enhanced the automated issue reporting feature to be robust in collecting
  gopls crash logs and handling transient errors during gopls upgrade.
  ([Issue 984](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/984),
  [2690](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2690)).
* The extension now respects user's `editor.parameterHints.enabled` and shows
  parameter hints after completion only if it is enabled.
  ([Issue 3071](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3071))
* Ran `npm audit fix` and that updated `semver` and `word-wrap` dependencies.
  ([CL 551055](https://go.dev/cl/551055)).

### Thanks

Thank you for your contribution @tekig, @rogeryk, @hyangah!

## v0.40.0

Date: 15 Nov, 2023

This extension uses [Go Telemetry](https://telemetry.go.dev/privacy) to gather insights
about the performance and stability of the extension and the language server it employs.
By default, Telemetry uploading is disabled, but starting from this version,
a small number of users will be prompted to enable it. Users can enable uploading of telemetry data
by either responding to the prompt or running the following command:

```
go run golang.org/x/telemetry/cmd/gotelemetry@latest on
```

Once uploading is enabled, the data will be sent to https://telemetry.go.dev
each week. You can find more information about this process at
[https://telemetry.go.dev/privacy](https://telemetry.go.dev) and in the
[gopls v0.14 release notes](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.14.0).

A comprehensive list of changes can be found in the complete
[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.40.0...v0.39.1).

### Changes

* In this release, we have removed legacy language feature providers that were supported
by outdated tools. As a result, features such as code completion, navigation,
documentation, diagnostics, and refactoring will only function
when the language server (`gopls`) is enabled.
([Issue 2799](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2799))

* The "Go: Fill struct" command has been retired. The same functionality is provided
as a [Code Action](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_code-actions-quick-fixes-and-refactorings)
for refactoring. You can refer to the screenshot for details.
([Issue 2107](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2107)))

* The "Go: Extract to function" and "Go: Extract to variable" commands are no longer needed,
as they have been replaced by Code Actions provided by gopls.
([Issue 2862](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2862))

* The "buildFlags" attribute for Go launch configuration now accepts a list of strings in
addition to a string. If using delve at v1.22.2 or newer, this list is passed directly to
delve. This should help with bugs related to parsing the string of buildFlags, such as in
[Issue 1831](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1831) and
[Issue 1027](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1027).
([Issue 3009](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3009))

* The "Go: Toggle Hide System Goroutines" command was added to make it easier to switch between
showing / hiding the system goroutines in the callstack view. This command is also
available in the callstack context menu. The default setting can be updated by updating
"hideSystemGoroutines" in either the launch.json or in the "go.delveConfig" setting.
([Issue 1797](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1797#issuecomment-1762145244))

### Fixes

* We have enhanced environment variable substitution. Environment variable references
like `${env:VAR}` in the `go.toolsEnvVars` setting
([Issue 2680](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2680)) and the `go.goroot` setting
([Issue 3006](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3006)) are now correctly substituted.
Patterns like `${VAR}` inside environment files (`go.testEnvFile`) can be used to reference
other environment variables as well. ([Issue 1902](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1902))

### Compatibilities

* This extension version requires VS Code 1.75 (January 2023 version) or newer.
The README.md provides a list of VS Code and Go version requirements.
* For tools installation managed by the extension, you need go1.18 or a newer version.
([Issue 2898](golang/vscode-go#2898))
* The extension has been tested with gopls v0.14 and delve v1.21.

## v0.39.1

Date: 17 Jul, 2023

This is a point release to update the link for the upcoming Go developer survey.
A list of changes can be found in the full [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.39.1...v0.39.0).

## v0.39.0

Date: 12 Jun, 2023

We are in the process of removing legacy language features that were replaced by `gopls` since early 2021. The versions released after September 2023 will no longer offer features like code completion, navigation, documentation, formatting, and refactoring if the language server is disabled. In this release, we are showing deprecation notification messages if you are using the legacy language features. ([Issue 2799](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2799))

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.39.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/55) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.39.0...v0.38.0).

### Changes
- Added the [`go.showWelcome`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings#goshowwelcome) setting that controls whether to show the Welcome page. ([PR 2704](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/pull/2704)) <!-- CL 501208 -->
- Report when `go.toolsManagement.go` setting is invalid and ignored. ([Issue 2753](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2753)) <!-- CL 501056 -->
- Removed `go.languageServerExperimentalFeatures` setting which was deprecated in v0.21.0. ([Issue 1109](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1109)) <!-- CL 501199 -->
- Deprecated settings that affect only legacy language features and tools. They will be removed in the release after September 2023. ([Issue 2799](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2799)) <!-- CL 501206 -->
- `"Go: Update/Install Tools"` will install the latest version of `golangci-lint` instead of a vetted, pinned version. The extension chose to pin the versions of third-party go tools it installs in order to manage version skew and reduce security risks. However, `golangci-lint` is frequently released and its community is active enough to handle compatibility/security issues. We decided to install the latest version by default. ([Issue 2763](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2763), [2485](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2485))

- Debug: show error when the process picker is hidden ([CL 499601](https://go.dev/cl/499601)). To learn more about the process picker in debug, see [Launch.json "processId" documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging#launchjson-attributes). <!-- CL 499601 -->
- Debug: `args` attribute now accepts a `string` typed value. The argument string is parsed into word arguments with rules similar to `bash` except that there is no shell expansion. This change allows to use vscode variables like `${input:args}`. ([Issue 2621](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2621)) <!-- CL 469378 -->
- The extension no longer cache PATH environment variable, which helps interoperate with extensions that modify `PATH`. ([Issue 2617](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2617)) <!-- CL 494555 -->
- Updated LSP to v3.17.3 and VS Code language client library to v8.1.0. This includes fixes for request ordering issues around full document sync and bugs around shutdown. <!-- CL 473157 -->
- Replaced the extension user survey link to https://go.dev/s/ide-hats-survey. ([CL 497536](https://go.dev/cl/497536)) <!-- CL 497536 -->
- Updated settings to sync with [gopls@v0.12](https://go.dev/s/gopls-v0.12).
- Third-party go tools dependencies: use gofumpt@v0.5.0 and revive@v1.3.2 and install staticcheck@v0.3.3 when building with go1.18 or older.

### Delopment process updates
- Updated `@vscode/vsce` version to address the [xml2js prototype pollution vulnerability report](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-776f-qx25-q3cc) <!-- CL 494997 -->

### Documentation
- Debugging documentation includes tips for debugging with `-trimpath`. ([Issue 2609](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2609))
- Added advanced [semantic syntax highlighting options](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/features#syntax-highlighting). ([Issue 2682](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2682))

### Thanks
- Thank you for your contribution, @fflewddur, @ZekeLu, @cuining, @weikanglim, @niklaskorz, @xmmak, @jamalc, @suzmue, @hyangah!

## v0.38.0

Date: 23 Feb, 2023

This release adds default `go` tasks to help build and test your Go projects.

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.38.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/50) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.37.1...v0.38.0).

### Changes
- Added default go task provider ([Issue 194](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/194)) <!-- CL 467697 -->
- Updated pinned golangci-lint version to fix memory leak issue with Go 1.20 ([Issue 2654](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2654))
- gopls releases will now have a staged rollout in VS Code ([CL 468497](http://go.dev/cl/468497)) <!-- CL 468497 -->
- Added extension keywords to make this extension easier to find in the VS Code Extension Marketplace ([Issue 2657](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2657)) <!-- CL 467698 -->
- Deleted the broken references codelens code ([Issue 2519](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2519)) <!-- CL 464098 -->
- Added support to handle missing variables in legacy debug adapter gracefully ([Issue 2397](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2397)) <!-- CL 462289 -->

### Development process updates
- Upgraded esbuild to support s390x ([Issue 2668](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2668)) <!-- CL 469915 -->
- Use --profile-temp for testing with clean env ([Issue 2458](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2458)) <!-- CL 468496 -->

### Thanks

Thank you for your contribution, @ankon, @hyangah, @jamalc, and @suzmue!

## v0.37.1

Date: 17 Jan, 2023

### Fixes
- Fixed spurious file creation bugs on branch switches. ([Issue 2570](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2570))

### Changes
- Added promotion for the annual Go developer survey (2023 Winter).

### Thanks
Thank you for your contribution, @suzmue!

## v0.37.0

Date: 19 Dec, 2022

This release includes new [static analysis features](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/features#analyze-vulnerabilities-in-dependencies) that report known vulnerabilities in your dependencies. These vulncheck analysis tools are backed by [Go's vulnerability database](https://go.dev/security/vulndb) and the Go language server's integration of [`govulncheck`](https://golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck").
Read [Go's support for vulnerability management](https://go.dev/blog/vuln) to learn about the Go team's approach to helping Go developers secure their open-source dependencies.

### Changes
- The new "Go: Toggle Vulncheck" command enables/disables imports-based vulnerability analysis. This requires gopls v0.11.0 or newer.
- Test and debug test code lenses are added to some subtests if the test names can be determined. ([Issue 2536](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2536))
- Gopls settings was updated to match gopls@v0.11.0.
- `"go.formatTool"` setting accepts a special value `"custom"`, which causes the extension to use the custom formatter configured with the setting `"go.alternateTools": { "customFormatter": <your custom tool name> }`. ([Issue 2503](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2503))
- The experimental "Go: Run Vulncheck (exp)" command was removed.
- The extension no longer bypasses Delve's Go version check by default. Users must install the delve version compatible with their Go version, or explicitly configure their launch configuration to pass the `--check-go-version=false` flag using the `dlvFlags` attribute. ([Go Delve Issue 3058](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/issues/3058))

### Fixes
- The editor survey prompt logic was adjusted for uniform sampling. ([Issue 2545](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2545))
- Fixed the crash bug when handling coverage profiles involving go `//line`-directive. ([Issue 2453](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2453))
- Updated dependencies to address [CVE-2022-37603](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37603) and [CVE-2022-24999](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24999).

### Thanks

Thank you for your contribution, @devuo, @pjweinbgo, @aarzilli, @tklauser, @hyangah, @suzmue, @jamalc!

## v0.36.0

Date: 7 Nov, 2022
A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.36.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/52) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.35.2...v0.36.0).

### Changes
- From this release, the extension will download specific versions of 3rd party tools installed with the "Go: Install/Update Tools" command. This is to enhance stability and security. The "Go: Install/Upate Tools" command will present the versions the extension will install. To install a different version of a tool, use `go install` command from the terminal instead. ([Issue 1850](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1850))
- The default gopls version was updated to v0.10.1 and the settings were updated accordingly. See the [release note of gopls v0.10.0](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.10.0) to learn about notable changes and new features.
- Typing `vars` will now offer a completion snippet that expands it to a `var (...)` block containing multiple variables. ([PR 2481](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/pull/2481))
- The setting to enable the "references" codelens, `go.enableCodeLens.references`, is now hidden. The feature remained broken for a while, so we plan to remove it in a future release. Please see [Issue 2509](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues#2509) for details.
- When debugging tests, the extension will open the "Debug Console". ([Issue 2409](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2409))

### Fixes
- Fixed [Issue 2525](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2525) that prevented triggering of parameter hints after method autocompletion. Users can enable/disable this parameter hints popup with the `"editor.parameterHints.enabled"` setting.
- Fixed [test profie feature](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/features#profiling) ([CL 440530](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/440530)).
- Removed dev dependency affected by CVE-2022-3517.

### Thanks
Thank you for your contribution, @jamalc, @hyangh!

## v0.34.0

Date: 22 June, 2022

This release adds support for [LSP 3.17](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#whatIsNew) and requires Visual Studio Code [1.67+](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67).

### Features
This release includes improvements to the `Go: Run Vulncheck (Experimental)` command ([Issue 2185](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2185), [2186](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2186), [2214](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2214)). Use it to find security issues in your dependencies.

### Documentation
Documentation for vscode-go can now be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki) ([Issue 2094](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2094)).

Thanks @thediveo for updating the debugging documentation!

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bugs in testing

### Thanks

Thank you for your contribution, @hyangah, @jamalc, @polinasok, @suzmue, @thediveo, and @dle8!

## v0.33.1

Date: 24 May, 2022

This is the last release that supports Visual Studio Code 1.66 or older.
We plan to add support for [LSP 3.17](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#whatIsNew) in the next release and the change requires Visual Studio Code [1.67+](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67).

### Changes

* Updated settings to be in sync with `gopls@v0.8.4`. See [the release note](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.8.4) to learn new features like the `//go:embed` analyzer, and improved hover for imported packages.
* Prepared for 2022 mid-year Go developer survey.

## v0.33.0

Date: 1 May, 2022

📣 [Remote attach debugging](docs/debugging.md#connecting-to-headless-delve-with-target-specified-at-server-start-up) is now available via Delve's native DAP implementation with Delve v1.7.3 or newer. It is now the default with the [Go Nightly](docs/nightly.md) and will become the default for the stable releases in mid 2022.

### Changes

* `staticcheck`: if go 1.16.x or older is used in installing tools, the extension chooses `staticcheck@v0.2.2`. In order to use the latest version of `staticcheck` while working on projects that require older versions of go, you can utilize the `"go.toolsManagement.go"` setting to specify a newer version of go for tool installation. ([Issue 2162](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2162))

* `go-outline`: `go-outline` is no longer required when `gopls` (v0.8.2+) is used.

* Activation: the extension defers commands and feature provider registrations until it runs `go version` and `go env`, and starts `gopls`. [This change](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/398155) prevent the extension prematually export its features, but may result in a slight increase in extension activation time if those commands run slow.

* Survey: we show the gopls opt-out survey prompt only when users change the setting to disable `gopls`.

* Test Explorer: fixed a bug in `go.mod` file parsing ([Issue 2171](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2171))

* Debugging: we removed the informational popup at the start of remote attach session with `dlv-dap`. ([Issue 2018](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2018))

### Experimental features

This version includes two highly experimental features. They are still
in early stage and we are looking forward to hearing more user feedback.

* [Go Explorer view](docs/ui.md#go-explorer-view): it displays environment variables and information about tools used by the extension. ([Issue 2049](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2049))

* `Go: Run Vulncheck (Experimental)` command: it runs the `govulncheck` command embedded in `gopls`, which identifies known vulnerabilities by call graph traversal and module dependency analysis. ([Issue 2096](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2096))

### Thanks

@jamalc, @polinasok, @dlipovetsky, @vladdoster, @suzmue, @hyangah

## v0.32.0

Date: 8 Mar, 2022

This version includes features to enhance Go 1.18 support. It works best when paired with the latest Go Language Server ([`gopls` v0.8.0+](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.8.0)) and Delve ([`dlv` v1.8.0+](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changelog)).

[Go 1.18](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18) introduces substantial changes to [the language spec](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18#generics), so many tools need rebuilding with Go 1.18 or newer. The extension now suggests updates of tools if it finds they were built with old versions of `go` which are inadequate for the version used for the project. If you [opted in for auto-update](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#gotoolsmanagementautoupdate), tools will be auto-updated.

In order to use Go 1.18, please follow [the instruction to configure your Visual Studio Code to locate the right go binary](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/advanced.md#using-go118), and run the Go tools using the "Go: Install/Update Tools" command.

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.32.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/42) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.31.1...v0.32.0).

### Changes

- Starting with Go 1.18,  the `go` command provides native support for multi-module workspaces, via  [`go.work`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces) files. The new "Open 'go.work'" option in the Go status bar's quickpick menu allows users to access the corresponding `go.work` file.
![go work short](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4999471/157268414-fba63843-5a14-44ba-be82-d42765568856.gif)

- The extension no longer depends on [`gopkgs`](https://github.com/uudashr/gopkgs/cmd/gopkgs). Its use for "Go: Browse Packages" and "Go: Add Import" commands had been replaced with `go list` or commands in `gopls`. ([Issue 258](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/258))

- The extension uses `gopls` instead of `go-outline` if `gopls` v0.8.0 or newer is used. We plan to complete the replacement work in the next release. ([Issue 1020](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1020))

- The new [`"go.toolsManagement.go"` setting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#gotoolsmanagementgo) allows users to specify the Go command for tools installation/updates separate from the Go command used for the project.

- The latest `gopls` requires go 1.13+ for installation, so the extension no longer asks for `gopls` updates when an older versions of `go` is used. ([Issue 2030](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2030)) Note `gopls` compiled with go 1.13 or newer can still process projects that use go 1.12. If you want to update `gopls` while working with an older version of Go, utilize the new `"go.toolsManagement.go"` setting.

- Reduced the verbosity of "Go: Locate Configured Go Tools" output.

### Code Health
- Updated to mocha@9.2.0 (CVE-2021-23566).
- Deflaked debug tests.
- Changed to check `go.dev/dl` instead of `golang.org/dl` for Go release.
- Improved documentation for the default formatting behavior  and template support.

## v0.30.0

Date: 16 Dec, 2021

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.30.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/40) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.29.0...v0.30.0).

### Changes

- Debugging
  - `dlv-dap` is pinned at [`@2f136727`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/commit/2f13672765fead22e5376fb4754c48a96c33cc0b).
  - Remote debugging support using `dlv-dap` is available.<br>Please follow [the instruction](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#remote-debugging) to enable remote debugging using `dlv-dap`. ([Issue 1861](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1861))
  - [Launch configuration](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#launchjson-attributes):
    - `showRegisters`([Issue 1527](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1527)). This was added to [`go.delveConfig`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#godelveconfig), too.
	- `hideSystemGoroutines`([Issue 1797](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1797)). This was added to [`go.delveConfig`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#godelveconfig), too. We plan to hide system goroutines by default in the next release, and it is already enabled in Nightly. Feedback is welcome!
	- `backend` accepts [`"rr"`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/usage/dlv_backend.md). Along with [`"mode": "replay"`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/usage/dlv_replay.md) support that has been available since v0.27.2, this concludes the work for the [rewind](https://twitter.com/belbaoverhill/status/1466911997174464513) feature support. ([Issue 110](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/110)). The feature requires [Mozilla's `rr`](https://github.com/mozilla/rr).
  - Runtime frames are no longer deemphasized. ([Issue 1916](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1916))
  - [Logpoints](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#breakpoints) support is available. ([Issue 123](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/123))
  - DEBUG CONSOLE accepts the new `dlv` command that allows users to dynamically inspect/adjust debug configuration. Please run `dlv help` from DEBUG CONSOLE to see the list of supported options.
  - Bug fixes:
    - Correctly infer `mode` for `attach` requests. ([Issue 1929](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1929))
	- Stop debugging when delve remote connection ends in `legacy` remote debugging. ([CL 366936](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/366936/))
	- Allow users to debug with older versions of `dlv-dap`. ([Issue 1814](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1814))

- Enabled Go template file processing. ([Issue 609](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/609)) By default, files with `.tmpl` and `.gotmpl` extension are treated as Go template files.
- Include `Fuzz*` functions in Testing UI and adds test codelens. ([Issue 1794](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1794)) <!-- CL 361935 -->
- `gofumports` is pinned at `v0.1.1`. We plan to remove it from the recognized formatter tool list since [`gofumports` is officially deprecated](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/releases/tag/v0.2.0) early next year.
- Disabled separate linting if gopls's 'staticcheck' is enabled. ([Issue 1867](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1867))
- Updated the in-editor user survey URL. ([CL 360775](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/366936))
- Limited Go file search scope for extension activation ([Issue 1894](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1894))
- Code Health
   - Enabled esModuleInterop. ([CL 349170](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/349170))
   - Bumped TS target to ES2017. ([Issue 1712](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1712))
   - Updated json-schema to 0.4.0

## v0.29.0

Date: 26 Oct, 2021

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.29.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/37) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.28.1...v0.29.0).

### Changes

- Prompt users for the 2021 Go Developer survey. `go.survey.prompt` is a new setting to control survey prompts.
- Use `go install` for tools installation when using go1.16+. From go1.18, `go get` will no longer build/install tools. See [the deprecation notice](https://golang.org/doc/go-get-install-deprecation). ([Issue 1825](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1825)) <!-- CL 355974 --> The extension runs `go install` from the workspace root directory, and the old workaround for [Issue 757](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/757) is unnecessary.
- Language Server:
  - Print all `GOPATH`s when there are multiple GOPATHs. ([Issue 1848](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1848)) <!-- CL 356909 -->
  - Synced settings @ gopls/v0.7.3
- "Go: Generate Interface Stubs" allows `'-'` as an acceptable char for interface names. ([Issue 1670](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1670)) <!-- CL 343829 -->
- Test UX:
  - Visualize profiles. ([Issue 1747](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1747)) <!-- CL 345477 -->
  - Added view for profiles. ([Issue 1641](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1641)) <!-- CL 345470 -->
  - Added single-test debugging support to the Test Explorer UI. ([CL 348571](https://golang.org/cl/348571))
  - Shows test output on run. ([CL 352309](https://golang.org/cl/352309))
- Debug:
  - Added `showLog`/`logOutput`/`dlvFlags` to `go.delveConfig` setting that change the default values for them. ([Issue 1723](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1723)) <!-- CL 351249 -->
  - Handle directory with `'.'` in its name correctly and warn users for invalid `program` ([Issue 1826](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1826), [1769](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1769)) <!-- CL 353990 -->

## v0.28.1

Date: 24 Sep, 2021

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.28.1 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/38) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.28.0...v0.28.1).

### Fixes
- Skipped launch configuration adjustment to address build errors when debugging using externally launched delve DAP servers. (Issue [1793](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1793))

## v0.28.0

Date: 20 Sep, 2021

This version requires VS Code 1.59 or newer.

🎉🧪 The extension implements [the Testing API of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/testing). You can navigate and run/profile tests using the test explorer UI! Windows support and further work for better profiling and debugging support through the test explorer is underway. Please give it a try and provide feedback.

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.28.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/34) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.27.2...v0.28.0).

### Changes

- Require VS Code engine 1.59+.
- Implement the Testing API ([Issue 1579](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1579)). <!-- CL 330809 -->
The test provider discovers all Go tests and benchmarks including `stretchr` test suits ([Issue 1641](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1641)) <!-- CL 343489 --> and sub-tests ([Issue 1641](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1641)). <!-- CL 343433 --> You can adjust behavior with the  [`go.testExplorer.*` settings](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#gotestexploreralwaysrunbenchmarks).
- Offer basic profiling support through the testing API. ([Issue 1685](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1685)) <!-- CL 344149 -->
- Debugging
	- Allow to connect to a Delve DAP server running on a different host using `host` and `port` launch properties. ([Issue 1729](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1729)) <!-- CL 346269 -->
	- Disabled check for active debug session ([Issue 1710](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1710)). <!-- CL 349596 --> This will allow to run multiple debug sessions simultaneously.
	- Disabled the go version check by supplying the `--check-go-version=false` delve flag ([Issue 1716](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1716)). <!-- CL 347562 --> This is to allow users of older versions of Go to debug using Delve DAP which requires Delve 1.6.1 or newer. If you need to use Delve 1.6.0 or older, please use [the legacy debug adapter](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging-legacy.md).
	- Fixed a legacy debug adapter's bug that broke remote debugging when breakpoints were set in irrelevant files. ([Issue 1762](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1762)) <!-- CL 348972 -->
	- Added [the new FAQs section](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#faqs).
- Removed tools version check hack that triggerred unnecessary warnings about go and tools version mismatch issues ([Issue 1698](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1698)). <!-- CL 349752 -->
- Export an API with which other extensions can query the location of go tools. ([Issue 233](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/233)) <!-- CL 336509 -->
- Fixed regexps for test function names ([CL 344130](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/344130)).
- Track the language server's restart history and include it in the automated gopls crash report ([CL 344130](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/344130)).
- Code Health
	- Use `esbuild` instead of `webpack` ([Issue 1705](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1705)). <!-- CL 343791 -->
	- Removed the temporary security workaround in favor of [VS Code's Workspace Trust concept](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust). <!-- CL 347690 -->
	- Updated the gopls settings documentation to reflect gopls/v0.7.2 settings.

### Thanks

Thank you for your contribution, Nicolas Lepage, 180909, Polina Sokolova, Rebecca Stambler, and Suzy Mueller! Special thanks to Ethan Reesor for the Test Explorer work!

## v0.27.2

Date: 1st Sep, 2021

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.27.2 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/36) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.27.1...v0.27.2).

### Enhancement
- Supports `replay` and `core` debug launch modes. ([PR 1268](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/pull/1268))
- `gopls` now watches changes in `go.work` files to support [Go Proposal 45713](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/45713-workspace.md).

### Fixes
- Fixed issues around building binaries for debugging when symlinks or case-insensitive file systems are involved. (Issues [1680](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1680), [1677](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1677), [1713](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1713))
- Clarified the `dlvLoadConfig` setting is no longer necessary with the new debug adapter (`dlv-dap`). ([CL 344370)(https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/344370))
- Increased the timeout limit from 5sec to 30sec. If `dlv-dap` still fails to start, please check firewall/security settings do not prevent installation or execution of the `dlv-dap` (or `dlv-dap.exe`) binary. ([Issue 1693](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1693))
- `Go: Install/Update Tools` command picks the `dlv-dap` from the main branch.

### Thanks
Thanks for your contributions, Suzy Mueller, Luis Gabriel Gomez, Polina Sokolova, Julie Qiu, and Hana Kim!

## v0.27.1

Date: 12 Aug, 2021

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.27.1 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/35) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.27.0...v0.27.1).


### Fixes
- Fixed process pickers used in attach mode debugging. ([Issue 1679](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1679))
- Fixed the failure of debugging when `CGO_CFLAGS` is set. ([Issue 1678](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1678))
- Fixed the `dlv-dap` installation issue. ([Issue 1682](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1682))

### Thanks
Thanks for your contributions, Luis Gabriel Gomez, Suzy Mueller, and Hana Kim!

## v0.27.0

Date: 9 Aug, 2021

📣 Delve's native DAP implementation ([`dlv-dap`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/usage/dlv_dap.md))
is enabled by default for local debugging. We updated the [Documentation for Debugging](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md)
to show the new features available with dlv-dap. This change does not apply to remote debugging yet.
For remote debugging, keep following the instruction in the
[legacy debug adapter documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging-legacy.md).

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.27.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/33?closed=1) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.26.0...v0.27.0).

### Enhancements
- The new [`go.terminal.activateEnvironment`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#goterminalactivateenvironment)
allows to prevent the extension from changing integrated terminal's environment variables. ([Issue 1558](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1558), [1098](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1098)) <!-- CL 336409 -->
- The [`Go: Locate Configured Go Tools`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/commands.md#go-locate-configured-go-tools)
command prints the build information of detected tools. <!-- CL 337989 -->
- Use `dlv-dap` as the default debug adapter for local debugging. The new debug adapter offers
[many new features and improvements](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3AFixedInDlvDAPOnly).
- Added Gitpod to a recognized Cloud-based IDE, for which the extension will minimize the number of toast or notification messages. ([Issue 1616](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1616))
- The [`Go: Subtest At Cursor`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/commands.md#go-subtest-at-cursor) command prompts for subtest name if there is no subtest at cursor ([Issue 1602](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1602)). <!-- CL 333309 -->

### Fixes
- Debugging
    - Setting the `logOutput` property without `showLog: true` does not break debugging any more. <!-- CL 335029 -->
    - Fixed a bug in the legacy debug adapter that caused jumping at each step after upgrading to VS Code 1.58+. ([Issue 1617](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1617), [1647](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1647)) <!-- CL 338194 -->
    - Fixed a bug that broke Attach mode debugging using the legacy debug adapter if `cwd` is not set. ([Issue 1608](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1608)) <!-- CL 334111 -->
    - Made the `dlv-dap` mode ignore the `port` property. It was initially suggested as a temporary alternative
    to the remote debugging, but we decided to revisit the functionality for better remote debugging support.
    Use the `debugServer` property if you want to connect to a manually launched `dlv dap` server.

### Code Health
- The version of `dlv-dap` is pinned to [v1.7.1-0.20210804080032-f95340ae1bf9](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/f95340ae1bf9fed8740d5fd39f5758d41770d967) and `dlv-dap` is marked as a required tool.
- Updated the hard-coded default gopls version string to v0.7.1.
- Added `tools/relnotes`, a script to help generate CHANGELOG.md. <!-- CL 256579 -->
- Added go1.17 RC to CI. ([Issue 1640](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1640)) <!-- CL 336310 -->
- Enabled tests that were skipped in dlv-dap mode since dlv-dap reached feature parity. <!-- CL 332109 -->
- Use StackOverflow as the channel for Q&A.

### Thanks

Thank you for your contribution, Ahmed W, Hana, Michael Currin, Polina Sokolova, Rebecca Stambler, Suzy Mueller, and Sven Efftinge!

[`substitutePath`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#launch-configurations) and shadowed variable annotation.

## v0.24.1

Date: 15 Apr, 2021

### Enhancements
- Cleaned up launch configuration snippets for easier debug setup
- To use `dlv-dap` by default for all launch configurations (including codelenses), set the `debugAdapter` field in the `go.delveConfig` setting ([Issue 1293](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1293))

adapter when debugging go code. See [the documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/dlv-dap.md#how-to-use-dlv-dap)
to learn more about Delve's native DAP implementation, and how to choose `dlv dap`.

Full list of issues and changes can be found in the [v0.24.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/25) and the [changes since v0.23.3](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.23.3...release).

### Enhancements
* Supports custom format tools when gopls is enabled. ([Issue 1238](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1238))
* Allows to use `dlv dap` for debugging.

### Fixes

Thanks for the contributions, @hoanggc, @suzmue, @rstambler, @polinasok!

## v0.23.3

Date: 19th Mar, 2021

### Enhancements

* Always check the gopls version before activating automated issue reporter regardless of the gopls update settings.
* Updated the hard-coded latest gopls version to v0.6.8 and the gopls settings.

## v0.23.2

Date: 12th Mar, 2021

### Fixes

* Updated the gopls version requirement. v0.23.1 requires v0.6.6+. ([Issue 1300](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1300))

## v0.23.1

Date: 11th Mar, 2021

🎉 &nbsp;&nbsp;We use [`staticcheck`](https://staticcheck.io/)
as the default lint tool. We also changed to use `goimports` for formatting when not using `gopls`.

This version requires VS Code 1.52 or newer.

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the
[v0.23.1 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/24?closed=1)
and the [changes since v0.22.1](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.23.0...v0.23.1)

### Enhancements

* Changed the default lint/format tools. ([Issue 189](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/189), [192](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/192))
* Enhanced `dlv-dap` start logic ([Issue 1270](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1270)) and improved output/error message forwarding. ([CL 296930](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/296930))

### Fixes

* Fixed the spurious popup message about the use of `goreturns`. ([CL 300430](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/300430))
* Fixed orphaned progress notification after restarting `gopls`. ([Issue 1153](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1153))
* Fixed cryptic error messages that appear when `gopls` commands fail. ([Issue 1237](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1237))
* Fixed incomplete folding range info issue caused by parse errors. Complete fix requires `gopls` v0.6.7+ ([Issue 1224](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1224))

### Code Health
* Updated LSP to 3.16.0 (stable), and DAP to 1.44.0.

## v0.23.0

Date: 4th Mar, 2021

Delve DAP is a new debug adapter embedded in `dlv`, the Go debugger.
It is written in Go, understands Go's data types and runtime better,
and is under active development. In this release, we added back
access to Delve DAP. Delve DAP is still in the experimental stage
and we appreciate any feedback and bug reports!

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the
[v0.23.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/21?closed=1)
and the [changes since v0.22.1](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.22.1...v0.23.0)

### Enhancements

* Improved debugging workflow of attaching to local process.
([Issue 183](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/183))
By setting `processId` to the command name of the process, `${command:pickProcess}`, or
`${command:pickGoProcess}` a quick pick menu will show a list of processes to choose from.
* Enabled access to Delve DAP again. Simplified the Delve DAP launch workflow
and removed the intermediate Node.JS adapter.
If `"debugAdapter": "dlv-dap"` is specified in launch.json configurations,
the extension will use Delve DAP for the debug session. When using Delve DAP,
install the dev version of `dlv` built from master
(`cd; GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@master`)
to pick up the latest bug fixes and feature improvement.
([Issue 23](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/23),
[822](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/822),
[844](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/844))
* Added an opt-in "Always Update" setting for `gopls` auto-update.
([Issue 1095](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1095))
* `Go: Reset Global State` and `Go: Reset Workspace State` commands are
available for easier extension state reset.
* Enabled survey to collect feedback from users who disabled `gopls`.
* Added a new setting (`"go.disableConcurrentTests"`) that prevents concurrent `go test` invocation.
([Issue 1089](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1089))

### Fixes
* [Issue 1113](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1113): error message when debugee terminates fast.
* [Issue 179](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/179): disable stackTrace error pop-ups during debugging.
* [CL 290289](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/290289): check incorrect gopls flag usage before automated gopls crash report.
* [Issue 948](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/948): show lint tool's name as the lint diagnostic collection name.
* [Issue 1252](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1252): search `C:\Program Files\Go\bin`,
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Go\bin\go.exe`, the new default Go installation path in Windows.

### Code Health

* Migrated to use `gts` to enforce consistent coding style. ([Issue 1227](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1227))
* Preview mode features are available in both Nightly and the dev version.
* Enabled integration test in Go module mode.
* Enabled Delve DAP integration test.
* Removed the `latest` branch.

Date: 21st Jan, 2021
A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.21.1 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/22?closed=1).

### Fixes
- Fixed the `Cannot get property 'get' of undefined` error. ([Issue 1104](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1104))
- Restored the `"go.languageServerExperimentalFeatures"` setting for users who depend on this to run custom vet analyzers. ([Issue 1110](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1110))

## v0.21.0

Date: 20th Jan, 2021

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.21.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/16?closed=1).

- Removed the `"go.languageServerExperimentalFeatures"` setting. ([CL 280601](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/280601)). The `documentLink` feature is replaced with `gopls`'s [`ui.navigation.importShortcut`](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#importshortcut-enum) setting. The `diagnostics` feature replacement is still under discussion. Please provide feedback in [Issue 50](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/50).

### Code Health
* Experimental features that were available only in the nightly extension are enabled in the master branch, and in presubmit & CI tests running on the master branch.
### Thanks

Thank you for your contribution, @hyangah, @suzmue, @pjweinbgo, @stamblerre!

## v0.20.2

Date: 8th Jan, 2021

### Enhancement

## v0.20.1

Date: 29th Dec, 2020

### Fixes
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect fallback to a common `go` installation path when `go` couldn't be found from the regular PATH ([Issue 1065](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1065))

## v0.20.0

Date: 22nd Dec, 2020

A list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.20.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/18?closed=1).

### Enhancements
- Debugging
    - The new `substitutePath` config property allows users to translate their symlinked directories to the actual paths, and
    the local paths to the remote paths. See [Launch Configurations](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#launch-configurations)
    and [Remote Debugging](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#remote-debugging) for details.
    - Quick pick menu for creating `launch.json` was added. ([Issue 131](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/131))
    - Report that `next` is automatically cancelled by delve if interrupted, for example, because breakpoint is set. See [Issue 787](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/787) for details. ([CL 261078](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/261078))
- The new `tyf` snippet for `type name func()` was added. ([Issue 1002](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1002))
- Include the `gopls` settings section definition based on `gopls` v0.6.0. ([Issue 197](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/197), [CL 278355](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/278355))
- `go.buildFlags` and `go.buildTags` are propagated to `gopls` unless `"gopls": {"buildFlags": ..}` is set. ([Issue 155](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/155))
- The new `go.toolsManagement.checkForUpdates` setting allows users to completely disable version checks.
This deprecates `go.useGoProxyToCheckForToolUpdates`. ([Issue 963](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/963))

### Fixes
- Added a workaround for [the VSCode `PATH` setup issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108003). When `go` isn't
found from `PATH`, the extension will check `/usr/local/bin` too ([Issue 971](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/971)).
- Fixed language client crashes or duplicate language features on the guest side of a VS Live Share session.
The initial fix added in v0.19.0 for VS Live Share wasn't sufficient. (Issue [605](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/605), [1024](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1024))
- Stop requiring to install legacy tools when the language server is used. ([Issue 51](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/51))
- Update `gopls` if the existing version in the system is older than the minimum required version when the extension enables `gopls` automatically. ([Issue 938](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/938))
- Show language server start progress and allow only one outstanding language server restart request. ([Issue 1011](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1011))
- Fixed a gocode-gomod installation bug that caused to ignore `GOBIN` setting. ([CL 275877](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/275877))
- Marked settings that are not applicable when using the language server. ([Issue 155](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/155))

### Code Health
- Deprecated unused settings such as `go.overwriteGoplsMiddleware` and marked deprecated settings.
- Improved stability of debug functionality tests on windows.
- Improve the automated gopls issue template message. It includes the extension name and version.
- Prompt users to file an issue for feedback when they choose to opt out of gopls.
- CI test workflow now runs `vsce package` to detect packaging errors early.

### Thanks
Thank you for your contribution, @hyangah, @suzmue, and @programmer04!

## v0.18.0

Date: 23rd Oct, 2020

Unified Go status UI ⚡, many debugger feature improvements, and LSP 3.16 features! A list of all issues fixed with this release can be found in the [v0.18.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/11?closed=1).

### New Features
- The new Go status bar provides a menu to manage the go version, open the gopls trace, open the `go.mod` file, and more. The old `Go Modules` status bar was removed in favor of this new unified status bar. See [VS Code Go UI documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/ui.md) to learn more about this.
- New `Go: Toggle gc details` command toggles the display of compiler optimization choice for the open Go source file ([CL 256658](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/256658)).
- Upgraded LSP to [`3.16`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/#whatIsNew). Users of recent `gopls` can access new features such as [`Call hierarchy`](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_33#_call-hierarchy) and [`Semantic tokens`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide#semantic-token-provider).

### Enhancement

- Debugging:
  * Correctly presents the reason when the debugged program stops due to `panic` and `fatal error` ([Issue 648](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/649)).
  * Be explicit about conditional breakpoint support ([Issue 781](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/781)).
  * Debug Adapter logs all the environment variables passed to dlv when verbose logging is enabled.
- Language Server Client: sends `gopls` config as LSP initialization options for correct workspace symbols computation ([CL 259138](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/259138)).
- Snippets: adds a placeholder for the `for` statement snippet ([Issue 734](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/734)).
- Excludes `vendor` directories from `go.inferGopath` disable mechanism ([Issue 301](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/301)).
- New `go.logging.level` setting allows extra logging to help debugging extension issues ([CL 256557](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/256557)).
- For Nightly extension users, `Go: Show Survey Config` and `Go: Reset Survey Config` commands are available.

### Fixes
- Fixed the bug that caused the debug adapter to leave bogus null items in the map type variable presentation ([Issue 199](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/199)).
- Fixed several debug adapter bugs that caused remote debug to hang ([Issue 740](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/740), [766](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/766), [761](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/761), [764](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/764)).
- Restored the correct handling of language server configuration change when users opt for enabling language server and installing `gopls`. ([CL 258997](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/258997)).
- Fixed a diagnostics error visualization issue when multiple files with errors are open ([Issue 743](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/743)).
- Changed the dependency tool installation to use the `go` command chosen from the current `GOROOT/bin`. This helps avoid using a different version of `go` command for `asdf` or `direnv` users ([Issue 757](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/757)).

### Documentation
- Documented the current limitation of symlink support in debugging ([CL 257204](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/257204)), improved the instruction for CLI application debugging ([CL 259677](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/259677)), and fixed syntax errors in example task configuration snippets ([CL 259077](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/259077)).

### Code Health
- Added an initial set of tests for debug adapters ([Issue 137](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/137)). We will keep working to improve our test coverage.

### Thanks

## v0.17.2

Date: 29th Sep, 2020

### Fixes
- Fixed a regression caused by the change for ([Issue 679](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/679)).
If `go` is not found from `PATH` available to the extension, the extension tries a couple of well-known
default locations to find the `go` binary. In this case, we need to mutate `PATH` so other tools including
`gopls` or `dlv` can choose the same go version. ([Issue 713](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/713)).

## v0.17.1

Date: 28th Sep, 2020

### Enhancement
- Mutate the `PATH`/`Path` environment variable only if users
explicitly configure to select the go command using `go.goroot`,
`go.alternateTools`, or `Go: Choose Go Environment` menu.
([Issue 679](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/679))
- Includes sanitized gopls crash traces in the automated gopls crash report.
([CL 256878](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/256878))

### Fixes
- Changed the default of `go.coverMode` to be `default`. ([Issue 666](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/666))
- Fixed a missing promise reject when go is not found. ([Issue 660](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/660))

Thank you for reporting issues!

## v0.17.0

Date: 18th Sep, 2020

Go code debugging and code coverage support is getting better.

The extension will help you stay updated with the new Go releases.

### New Features

- Delve's [call](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli#call) feature is now accessible.
To use this feature, explicitly specify the `call` command. E.g. `call myAwesomeFunc()`.
It is an experimental feature in Delve.
Please see [the current limitations](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli#call).
([Issue 100](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/100))
- The extension checks the go official download site and notifies users of
newly available Go versions. When a newer version is available,
`Go Update Available` status bar item will appear.
This feature is available only if `go.useGoProxyToCheckForToolUpdates`
is set true. ([Issue 483](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/483))
- The new `go.coverMode` setting allows to use different coverage modes
(`atomic`, `count`, `set (default)`). `go.coverShowCounts`,
`go.coverageDecorator.{coveredBorderColor, uncoveredBorderColor}`
were newly added. We are still investigating better ways to
visualize the `count` coverage data; feedback and contribution is welcome!
(Issue [256](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/256),
[594](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/594))

### Enhancement

- Expands `'~'` in the `cwd` attribute of the launch configuration.
([Issue 116](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/116))
- Debug config's `showGlobalVariables` is disabled by default, and
this change improves speed. You can still inspect the global
variables by registering them in the `WATCH` section, or by
configuring `showGlobalVariables` in `launch.json`.
([Issue 138](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/138))
- `gofumpt`, `gofumports` is added to recognized formatters list.
([Issue 587](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/587))
- Automatically restarts the language server if `go.toolsEnvVars` configuration is changed.
([CL 254370](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/254370))
- Reports `go env` failures.
([Issue 555](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/555))

### Fixes
- Fixed to use absolute file paths in error messages appearing in the DEBUG OUTPUT.
This allows VS Code to locate the correct files.
([Issue 456](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/456))
- Fixed handling of absolute file paths in coverage profile, on windows.
([Issue 553](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/553))
- Changed to pass `GOROOT` when invoking the `gopkgs` tool so `gopkgs`
continues to work with different go versions without being recompiled.
([CL 254137]( https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/254137))
- Fixed to provide explicit directory for running go list and go version.
([Issue 610](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/610),
CL [253600]( https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/253600),
[253602]( https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/253602))
- Fixed to trigger extension activation when commands for diagnostics,
such as `Go: Locate Configured Go Tools` are invoked.
([Issue 457](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/457))
- Fixed to prepend `GOROOT/bin` to integrated terminal's PATH
environment variable when `go.goroot` is set on OS X.
([Issue 544](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/544))
- Fixed to correctly apply environment variables setting read from `envFile`
in the launch configuration. We reworked how the environment variables
configuration is processed during this cycle. Now the extension processes
the `envFile` attribute instead of asking the debug adapter process to
read the specified `envFile`.
([Issue 452](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/452))
- Disabled `go.installDependenciesWhenBuilding` by default. When this is
enabled, the extension runs `go` commands with `-i`, which is no longer
recommended with recent versions of Go.
([Issue 568](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/568))
- Fixed a bug where we are not sending back 'configuration done' response.
([Issue eclipse-theia/theia#8455](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/8455),
[CL 254959](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/254959))

### Documentation

- Added new documentation about
[switching go versions](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/go-version.md),
and settings for [standard library development](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/stdlib.md).
- Improved debugging instruction and contribution guide. Enhanced automated settings documentation generation.

### Code Health

- Removed the obsolete string-type coverageDecorator support.
([Issue 519](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/519))
- When gopls integration tests fail, tests print the observed gopls traces
to help debugging.

### Experimental Features

- We plan to delegate computation of various `run test` CodeLenses to `gopls`.
This experimental feature can be enabled with the following setting:
```
"go.useLanguageServer": true,
"gopls": {
	"codelens": { "test": true }
}
```

### Thanks

Thank you for your contribution, @suzmue, @pjweinbgo, @ekulabuhov, @stamblerre, @tpbg, @FiloSottile, @findleyr, @quoctruong, @polinasok, @hyangah!

## v0.16.2

Date: 2nd Sep, 2020

### Fixed

- Fixed the compile error message parsing bug that prevented correct file name expansion in test output. ([Issue 522](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/522)).
- Fixed the regression that caused to run tests in the local directory mode and
  result in more verbose output than the package list mode. ([Issue 528](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/528)).
- Fixed `"go.alternateTools"` settings to accept any tool names without
  settings.json diagnostics warning. ([Issue 526](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/526))


## v0.16.1

Date: 5th Aug, 2020

### Fixed

- Fixed the bug that made test output verbose by default ([Issue 471](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/469)).
- Fixed the extension host crash bug due to a process-wide uncaught exception handler accidentally installed along with the inlined debug adapter. This crash bug also caused connection drops when used with the VS Code Remote extension ([Issue 467](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/467), [469](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/469)).
- Readded the predefined variable resolution support for `go.goroot` and `go.toolsEnvVars` ([Issue 464](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/464), [413](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/413)).

## v0.16.0

Date: 3rd Aug, 2020

This version requires VS Code 1.46+.

Older versions of VS Code will not receive updates any more.

### New Features

- Users can select/install a different version of Go with `Go: Choose Go Environment` command.
When clicking the `Go` status bar that displays the currently active Go version, users will be
prompted with the list of Go versions installed locally or available for download.
This feature was built based on the [`golang.org/dl`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl?tab=overview)
tools.
The selected Go version applies to the workspace, takes precedence over the
system default or the `"go.goroot"` and `"go.alternateTools"` settings, and persists
across sessions. You can clear the choice by selecting the `Clear Selection` item.
([Issue 253](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/253))
- When the Go version changes, the extension prepends `$GOROOT/bin` to the `PATH` or `Path`
environment variable which then applies the change to the integrated terminal windows.
- This version includes an experimental version of the new Debug Adapter that uses Delve's
native DAP implementation. It currently supports `launch` type requests in `debug` or `test`
mode. This is still in the early stages and requires
[`dlv`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) built from its unreleased, master
branch. Subscribe to
[golang/vscode-go#23](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/23) for updates.

### Enhancement

- Bundles the extension using webpack, which reduced the extension size
(4.7MB -> 1MB) and the extension loading overhead (3.4K files -> 3 files)
([Issue 53](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/53)).
- `Go: Apply Cover Profile` applies code coverage for multiple packages
([CL 238697](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/238697)).
We fixed bugs in processing coverage profiles on Windows.
- Suggests the official Go download page when no `go` tool is found.
- Utilizes the `GOMODCACHE` environment variable, introduced in
[Go 1.15](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.15#go-command).
- Prevents multiple debug sessions from launching
([Issue 109](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/109)).
- Streams test output when tests run with the `-v` option.
This feature requires 1.14 or newer versions of Go
([Issue 316](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/316)).
- Sets `additionalProperties` to `false` for the settings that don't expect
more properties. This allows VS Code to handle these settings better in
its new settings GUI ([Issue 284](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/pull/284)).
- `Go: Locate Configured Go Tools` includes `go env` results
([Issue 195](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/195)).
- Avoids prompting users to switch the default format tool in modules mode
if users enable the language server.

### Fixed

- Fixed the `PATH` environment variable adjustment when users use a wrapper as an alternate
tool for `go` ([CL 239697](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/239697)).
- Fixed a bug in test output processing, which prevented VS code from linking test log messages with locations in the source file.
- Fixed a `gocode-gomod` installation bug when `GOPATH` includes multiple directories
([Issue 368](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/368)).
- Avoids attempting to kill already terminated processes ([Issue 334](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/334)).
- Fixed `godef` to locate standard packages correctly by passing the `GOROOT` environment variable.
- Fixed a `golangci-lint` integration bug that prevented displaying the lint results correctly when
linters like `nolintlint` are enabled ([Issue 411](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/411)).
- Fixed lost test function name arguments when running `Go: Test Previous`
([Issue 269](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/269)).

### Code Health

- Many enhancements to improve test reliability and test coverage were made during this dev cycle.
- TryBot is enabled, and the test results are posted to Gerrit CL. Currently, only the internal team members
can see the details of the test results, but we will continue working to make them public.
- Windows tests are now fixed and enabled in GitHub Action-based CI.
- Refactored code shared by the extension and the debug adapters to prevent accidental debug adapter breakages.
- Updated `json-rpc2` and `lodash` to address vulnerability reports from `npm audit`.

## v0.15.2

Date: 21st July, 2020

### Fixed

- Do not fail tools installation when gocode is not already running ([Issue 355](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/355)).

## v0.15.1

Date: 7th July, 2020

### Enhancement

- Improved `gopls` error report suggestion and changed to send reports to the vscode-go issue tracker instead of the go issue tracker ([cl/240506](https://golang.org/cl/240506)).

### Fixed

- Removed the `preview` note in the published extension ([Issue 273](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/273)).

## v0.15.0

Date: 29th June, 2020

### New Features

- The new command `Go: Subtest At Cursor` runs an individual subtest if the subtest's name is a simple string ([cl/235447](https://golang.org/cl/235447)).
- The new setting `go.trace.server` controls tracing between VS Code and the language server ([cl/232458](https://golang.org/cl/232458)). Unlike tracing using `gopls` [flags](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/troubleshooting.md#vs-code), this controls client-side tracing, and does not require to restart the server to change the value. This client-side trace is presented in the `gopls` output channel. The server-side trace has been moved to the new `gopls (server)` output channel ([cl/233598](https://golang.org/cl/233598)).
- There is now a new Go version status bar item. Clicking it currently only pops up the current `GOROOT`. We plan to add Go version switch, and other features using this status bar item.

### Enhancement

- `Go: Add Tags To Struct Fields` prompts transform parameter input if the setting `go.addTags.promptForTags` is true ([Issue 2546](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go/issues/2546)).
- `Go: Locate Go Tools` command output includes the `GOBIN` value. ([cl/235197](https://golang.org/cl/235197)).
- Improved debugging experience
    - The debug adapter automatically infers the mapping between remote and local paths for easy remote debugging ([cl/234020](https://golang.org/cl/234020), [Issue 45](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/45)).
    - The debug adapter handles errors that can occur during remote connection setup ([cl/237550](https://golang.org/cl/237550), [Issue 215](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/215)).
    - Failed watch expression evaluation no longer pops up error message windows. The error is visible in the watch window instead ([cl/236999](https://golang.org/cl/236999), [Issue 143](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/143)).
- Better language server integration
    - Restart the language server automatically when changes in its configuration or the language server version are detected ([cl/232598](https://golang.org/cl/232598), [cl/233159](https://golang.org/cl/233159)).
    - Prompts user to file an issue if `gopls` crashes ([cl/233325](https://golang.org/cl/233325)).
- `go.gopath`, `go.goroot`, `go.toolsGopath` are now [machine-overridable](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#Configuration-property-schema) ([cl/236539](https://golang.org/cl/236539), [Issue 2981](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go/issues/2981)).
- The extension does not mutate the `GOROOT` environment variable any more. `go.goroot` is used to select the `go` command under the specified directory ([Issue 146](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/146)).
- A redundant code action provider was removed when using the language server ([cl/239284](https://golang.org/cl/239284)).

### Fixed

- Fixed `gopls` version detection and upgrade logic when pre-release versions are involved ([cl/235524](https://golang.org/cl/235524)).
- Processes started with `Run > Run Without Debugging (^F5)` are now cleaned up when the run sessions end ([cl/236879](https://golang.org/cl/236879)).
- When `go.alternateTools.go` is set, the path to `$(go env GOROOT)/bin` is passed to underlying tools to ensure they use the same `go` version ([cl/239697](https://golang.org/cl/239697)).
- Now the extension avoids invoking buggy `pgrep` on mac OS ([cl/236538](https://golang.org/cl/236538), [Issue 90](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/90)).

### Code Health

- More test coverage
    - Added new tests for gopls update logic ([cl/233158](https://golang.org/cl/233158)), tools installation behavior ([cl/233557](https://golang.org/cl/233557)).
    - Fixed Build Tags checking tests ([cl/233517](https://golang.org/cl/233517)).
- Upgraded dependencies including websocket-extensions from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4 ([cl/228617](https://golang.org/cl/228617), [cl/236839](https://golang.org/cl/236839), [pr/3261](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go/pull/3261)).

    * Use `go run .` instead of passing the current file to the `go run` command when the command `Run: Start Without Debugging` command is executed with the `program` attribute in the debug configuration pointing to a folder. Previously, this would result in errors for cases when the current file uses members from a separate file in the same pacakge. [Feature Request 3096](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/3096) implemented with [commit 78518d7e](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go/commit/78518d7e9736670d75fe2cd648c7c3eb23413157)

## 0.6.66

Date: 2nd October, 2017

### [Multi Root support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_15#_preview-multi-root-workspaces) when using [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)

We now have [Multi Root support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_15#_preview-multi-root-workspaces) for Go. [PR 1221](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1221) Please note:
* The settings at Folder level takes precedence over the ones at the Workspace level which in turn take precedence over the ones at the User level
* You can have the different roots in the multi-root mode use different GOPATHs. The experimental language server feature is not supported in such cases though.
* All current Go related features that refer to "workspace" will refer to the individual roots in the multi root mode. For example: Build/lint/vet/test workspace or `Go to Symbol in workspace`.
* Give it a try and log any issues that you find in the [vscode-go repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues)

### Auto-completion improvements

* [Nuruddin Ashr (@uudashr)](https://github.com/uudashr)

    * Completions from sub vendor packages that were showing up are ignored now. Fixes [Bug 1251](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1251)
    * The `package` snippet completion is now smarter when suggesting package names. [PR 1220](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1220). It suggests
        * `main` when current file is `main.go` or there exists a `main.go` file in current folder
        * The folder name when the current file is `internal_test.go`
        * The folder name with `_test` when current file is a test file
        * If the folder name in above cases has `-` or `.`, then what appears after the `-` or `.` is suggested.
* [Alexander Kohler (@alexkohler)](https://github.com/alexkohler)
    * A new setting `go.useCodeSnippetsOnFunctionSuggestWithoutType` is introduced. This allows completions of functions with their parameter signature but without the parameter types. [Feature Request 1241](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1241)
* [Miklós @kmikiy](https://github.com/kmikiy)
    * 3 New snippets for the `Log` methods from the `testing` package

* [Nuruddin Ashr (@uudashr)](https://github.com/uudashr)
    * `Go: Browse Packages` command will now include newly installed/built packages without the need for reloading VS Code.
* [Hugo (@juicemia)](https://github.com/juicemia)
    * A new command `Go: Get Package` is introduced to run `go get` on the package in the import statement under the cursor. [PR 1222](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1222)

## 0.6.65

Date: 6th September, 2017

[Seonggi Yang (@sgyang)](https://github.com/sgyang)
* [Bug #1152](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1152): Auto completions for unimported packages do not work anymore on certain machines. [PR 1197](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1197)

[Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
* [Bug #1194](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1194) and [Bug #1196](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1196): Debugger doesnt use GOPATH from env in debug configuration
* Go to implementation cmd doesnt show up when using the language server.

## 0.6.64

Date: 5th September, 2017

* [Dan Mace (@ironcladlou)](https://github.com/ironcladlou), [Vincent Chinedu Okonkwo (@codmajik)](https://github.com/codmajik) & [Dima (@hummerd)](https://github.com/hummerd)
    * Support for the `Go To Implementation` command on interfaces. [Feature Request #771](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/771).
* [Craig-Stone (@Craig-Stone)](https://github.com/Craig-Stone)
    * Normalize program path in Windows which otherwise prevented breakpoints from being set correctly when remote debugging. [PR 1131](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1131)
* [Marwan Sulaiman (@marwan-at-work)](https://github.com/marwan-at-work)
    * Refactor the code behind `Go: Browse Packages` to make browsing selected package faster. [PR 1136](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1136)
* [Thomas Darimont (@thomasdarimont)](https://github.com/thomasdarimont)
    * A new snippet called `helloweb` that generates a web app with an http endpoint returning a greeting and current time. [PR 1113](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1113)
* [Nuruddin Ashr (@uudashr)](https://github.com/uudashr)

* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Test Improvements
        * Show test coverage after the command `Go: Test Package` is run. You can disable this by setting `go.coverOnTestPackage` to `false`.

        * Decouple running test coverage on save from running build/lint/test on save. Fixes the issue where the problems view was not getting updated until `go.coverOnSave` was disabled.
    * Debugging Improvements
        * No need to set GOPATH in debug configuration in the `launch.json` file anymore. When no GOPATH is provided this way, the debug adapter will now infer the GOPATH based on the path of the file/package being debugged. This fixes [Issue #840](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/840).
        * The debug code lens will now honor the `go.buildFlags`, `go.buildTags` and `go.testFlags` settings. Fixes [Issue #1117](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1117)

## 0.6.63

Date: 26th July, 2017

### Features

* [Ian Chiles (@fortytw2)](https://github.com/fortytw2)
    * Option to use [megacheck](https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/tree/master/cmd/megacheck) as a linting tool which
can have significantly better performance than `gometalinter`, while only supporting a subset of the tools. Use the setting `go.lintTool` to try this.
* [alexandrevez (@alexandrevez)](https://github.com/alexandrevez)
    * Option to highlight gutters rather than full text for code coverage. Use the new setting `go.coverageDecorator` to try this.
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a) & [Marwan Sulaiman (@marwan-at-work)](https://github.com/marwan-at-work)
    * Browse packages and go files with new command `Go: Browse Packages`. [Feature Request 330](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/330)
         - If cursor is on an import statement, then files from the imported package will be shown in the quick pick control
         - Else, all packages are shown in the quick pick control. Select any and corresponding Go files will be shown next.
         - Selecting any of the Go files, will open the file in a new editor.
* [Saud Khan (@bidrohi)](https://github.com/bidrohi)
    * Print import paths of Go tools as they get installed. [PR 1032](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1032)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Prompt to update dependent Go tools when there is a change in the Go version. [Feature Request 797](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/797)
    * Better user experience when dependent Go tools are missing. [Feature Request 998](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/998)
         - Prompts will only show up for tools that are used for features that are explicitly executed by the user. Eg: Rename, Generate Unit Tests, Modify tags. And not for features that get triggered behind the scenes like linting, hover or format on save.
         - When the prompts do show up, closing them will ensure that they wont show up for the duration of the current session of VS Code.

    * `Go: Generate Interface Stubs` should work when interface is prefixed with package path


## 0.6.62

Date: 9th June, 2017

### Features
* [Jamie Stackhouse (@itsjamie)](https://github.com/itsjamie)
   * New command `Go: Generate interface stub` to generate stubs that implement given interface using [impl](https://github.com/josharian/impl). [PR 939](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/939)
        - When the command is run, you are prompted to provide interface name. Eg: `f *File io.Closer`
        - The stubs are then generated where the cursor is in the editor.
* [Guilherme Oenning (@goenning)](https://github.com/goenning)
    * New setting `go.testEnvFile` to configure the location of a file that would have environment variables to use while running tests. [PR 971](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/971)
        - File contents should be of the form `key=value`.
        - Values from the existing setting `go.test.EnvVars` will override the above
        - These environment variables will also be used by the "Debug Test" codelens
        - When debugging using the debug viewlet or pressing `F5`, the above will not be used. Continue to use the `env` and/or `envFile` property in the debug configurations in the `launch.json` file.
* [Ole (@vapourismo)](https://github.com/vapourismo)
    * You can now run build/lint/vet on the whole workspace instead of just the current package on file save. [PR 1023](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1023)
        - To enable this, the settings `go.buildOnSave`, `go.lintOnSave` and `go.vetOnSave` now take values `package`, `workspace` or `off` instead of the previous `true`/`false`.
        - These features are backward compatible and so if you are still using `true`/`false` for these settings, they will work as they did before, but you will get a warning in your settings file.
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Better build performance when working on main packages and test files by using the `-i` flag.
    * Better linting experience while running `gometalinter` by using the `--aggregate` flag which aggregates similar errors from multiple linters.

    * Fix for [Bug 964](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/964) The setting `go.referencesCodeLens.enabled` is deprecated in favor of `go.enableCodeLens` to control multiple types of codelens.
        ```json
        "go.enableCodeLens": {
            "references": false,
            "runtest": true
        }

    * Fix for [Bug 947](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/947) Mac users using the latest delve from master may see that all env variables are empty while debugging their code. This is due to delve using the `--backend=lldb` option in Mac by default. You can now change this default value by setting the `backend` property to `native` in the `launch.json` file. [Commit 4beecf1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/commit/4beecf1db2aaa18b336be2ee64476b56202fc959). Root cause is expected to be fixed in delve itself and is being tracked in [derekparker/delve/818](https://github.com/derekparker/delve/issues/818)

Best used to ignore vendor folders while doing a workspace symbol search. [PR 795](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/795)

## 0.6.55

Date: 3rd March, 2017
* Re-publishing the extension from a non Windows machine as the fix for [Bug 438](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/438) worked only on Windows machines.
For details read the discussion in [PR 838](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/838).

## 0.6.54

Date: 28th February, 2017

### Tooling improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a) and [Sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver)
    * A new setting `go.useLanguageServer` to use the Go language server from [Sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver) for features like Hover, Definition, Find All References, Signature Help, Go to Symbol in File and Workspace. [PR 750](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/750)
        * This is an experimental feature and is not available in Windows yet.
        * If set to true, you will be prompted to install the Go language server. Once installed, you will have to reload VS Code window.
        The language server will then be run by the Go extension in the background to provide services needed for the above mentioned features.

### GOPATH improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Fix for [Bug 623](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/623). `${workspaceRoot}` and `~` are now supported in `go.gopath` and `go.toolsGopath` settings. [PR 768](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/768)
    * The default GOPATH used by Go 1.8 when none is set as environment variable is now supported by the extension as well. [PR 820](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/820)
* [Vincent Chinedu Okonkwo (@codmajik)](https://github.com/codmajik)
    * Added new setting `go.inferGopath`. When `true` GOPATH will be inferred from the path of the folder opened in VS Code.
    This will override the value from `go.gopath` setting as well as the GOPATH environment variable. [PR 762](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/762)

### Debugging improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Debug current file without a launch configuration file. Simply press `F5` to start the debug session.
    A `launch.json` is still required to debug tests or for advanced debug configurations. [PR 769](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/769)
    * Launch configuration snippets are now available for common scenarios like debugging file/package or debugging a test package/function.
    These snippets can be used through IntelliSense when editing the `launch.json` file. [PR 794](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/794)
    * Fix for [Bug 492](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/492). Now when there are build errors, starting a debug session will display the error instead of hanging. [PR 774](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/774)
* [Rob Lourens (@roblourens)](https://github.com/roblourens)
    * Fix for [Bug 438](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/438). Now when you stop a debug session, all processes started by the session will be closed as well. [PR 765](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/765)
* [Suraj Barkale (@surajbarkale-dolby)](https://github.com/surajbarkale-dolby)
    * Fix for [Bug 782](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/782). Helpful error messages when the `program` attribute in `launch.json` file is invalid or not a full path. [PR 790](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/790)
* [F0zi (@f0zi)](https://github.com/f0zi)
    * Fix for [Bug 689](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/689). When debugging against a remote machine, paths anywhere under the GOPATH will be correctly mapped so you can set breakpoints in them.
    Previously only paths next to the program could be debugged. [PR 742](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/742)

### Testing improvements
* [Oleg Bulatov (@dmage)](https://github.com/dmage)
    * Added new setting `go.testOnSave`. When `true`, all tests in the current package will be run on saving a Go file.
    The status of the tests will be shown in the status bar at the bottom of the VS Code window. It is not advised to have this on when you have Auto Save enabled. [PR 810](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/810)
* [Jeff Willette (@deltaskelta)](https://github.com/deltaskelta)
    * Test output is no longer verbose by default. Add `-v` to the `go.testFlags` to get verbose output. [PR 817](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/817)

### Other Bug Fixes
* [Richard Musiol (@neelance)](https://github.com/neelance)
    * Fix offset for files with multibyte characters so that features like Hover and Go To Definition work as expected. [PR 780](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/780)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Fix for [Bug 777](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/777) Less disruptive experience during test failures when `go.coveronSave` is `true`.
    * Fix for [Bug 680](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/680) Reduce noise in Go to Symbol in File feature by removing the entries corresponding to import statements. [PR 775](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/775)


## 0.6.53

Date: 30th January, 2017

### Installation improvements
* [Sam Herrmann (@samherrmann)](https://github.com/samherrmann), [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    *  A new setting `go.toolsGopath` for providing an alternate location to install all the Go tools that the extension depends on, if you don't want them cluttering your GOPATH. [PR 351](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/351) and [PR 737](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/737).
        * This is useful when you work on different GOPATHs.
        * Remember to run `Go: Install Tools` command to install the tools to the new location.
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * All the "Install tool" options (the pop ups you see) and the `Go: Install Tools` command now support `gometalinter` if it is your chosen linting tool. [PR 735](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/735).
        * Since `gometalinter` internally installs linters and expects them to be in the user's GOPATH, `gometalinter` will get installed to your GOPATH and not the alternate location specified in `go.toolsGopath`

### Build improvements
* [Matt Aimonetti (@mattetti)](https://github.com/mattetti)
    * While building, we now use the `-i` flag (for non main packages) which installs dependent packages, which in turn get used in subsequent builds resulting in faster builds in bigger workspaces. [PR 718](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/718)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Build errors with no line numbers (for eg. Import cycle) are now displayed in the output window and will be mapped to the first line of the file. [PR 740](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/740)

### Test improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * A new setting `go.testFlags` that can be used to run tests. If null, `go.buildFlags` will be used. [PR 482](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/482)
    * Customize flags for each of the test command by using different keybindings. [PR 482](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/482). In the below example, `ctrl+shift+t` is bound to run the tests in current file with `-short` flag. The commands here can be `go.test.package`, `go.test.file` or `go.test.cursor`.

        ```json
        {
            "key": "ctrl+shift+t",
            "command": "go.test.file",
            "args": {
                "flags": ["-short"]
            },
            "when": "editorTextFocus"
        }
        ```
    * New toggle command `Go: Toggle Test File` that lets you toggle between your Go file and the corresponding test file. Previous commands `Go: Open Test File` and `Go: Open Implementation For Test File` have been deprecated in favor of this new command. [PR 739](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/739). You can add a keyboard binding to this as below:

        ```json
        {
            "key": "ctrl+shift+t",
            "command": "go.toggle.test.file",
            "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'go'"
        }
        ```
    * If current file is not a test file, show error message while running test commands, instead of displaying success message. Fixes [#303](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/303)
* [Marcel Voigt (@nochso)](https://github.com/nochso)
   * Show error message in output window when running test coverage fails. [PR 721](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/721)

### Debugging improvements
* [Andreas Kuhn (@ankon)](https://github.com/ankon)
   * Honor the `cwd` launch configuration argument. [PR 714](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/714)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
   * GOPATH set in the `env` property in `launch.json` will also be used to find `dlv` tool. [PR 725](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/725).
* [Rob Lourens (@roblourens)](https://github.com/roblourens)
   * New property `trace` in `launch.json` to provide option to have verbose logging while debugging using vscode-debug-logger. [PR 753](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/753). This will help in diagnosing issues with debugging in the Go extension.
